# DisableWeaponsPRG

Requires CounterStrikeSharp

Once loaded, the plugin will generate a config file where you can add the weapons you want to be completely restricted from the game.

The generated config has a parameter if you would like the file to be treated as a whitelist (when true, listed weapons are allowed) instead of a blacklist (when false, listed weapons are not allowed).
